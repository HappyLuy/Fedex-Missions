<br/>
Expected Enemy Forces: Ambushes<br/>
<br/>
Friendly Forces: ?<br/>
<br/>
Situation: <br/>
The climate in Taskistan was always border-lined in the eyes of NATO. Constant firefights and village raids were the norm each day and it took a few years for NATO forces to minorly support the civilians. In recent months those raids have majorly increased however, especially with NATO and UN handing out supplies to the civilians though NATO's support is starting to become more and more insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Mission: <br/>
A Czech team was dispatched to deliver needed supplies to civilians and while doing so also patroling the areas around the designated drop off points.<br/>
<br/>
Objectives: <br/>
1: Patrol the marked areas.<br/>
2: Deliver medical supplies to the designated areas.<br/>
<br/>
Notes: Civilians may be in the area!<br/>
